        In October, 2019, I saw a shop being renovated on my way home from school, and I saw him writing recruitment information at the door. So my friend and I decided to send a message to the phone number left on the recruitment information. I didn't get a reply at first. Until three days later, the owner of the tea shop sent me a text message and set an interview time. He asked me about my previous work experience, when I could go to work, whether I had legal status to work, and what my salary was. I replied that I hope my salary can be $13 an hour, and I can go to work after 5: 00 p.m. from Monday to Friday and all day on weekends. I didn't get a reply immediately. He told me to go home and wait for news. He will inform me within 5 working days. Fortunately, I got his approval and successfully joined the company. I resigned in March 2020 because of COVID-19.<br><br>

        Shengkee Bakery Part time Cashier<br><br>
        In February 2018, when I just turned 16, I asked my high school principal to take a form to prove that I could go to work.When I was 15 years old, I saw a recruitment message, so I went to the store and asked the staff if they still needed recruitment. Soon they called out the manager, who asked me about my age, whether I had been allowed by the school and whether I could work legally. She also told me that my salary is based on the minimum wage in the city, because I only work part-time, but I will consider increasing my salary if my follow-up work is good. The manager also asked me when I could go to work because I was a high school student. I told her that I can be free all day on weekends and after school every day, that is, after 3:30PM from Monday to Friday. My first job was to introduce the products and packaging to the guests. After three months, I successfully became a cashier, which is easier than my previous job. I just need to tell the guests how much they need to pay, instead of walking around like before. And my salary has changed from $12.25 to $13.5 an hour. I quit my job because I moved, and my home is an hour's drive away from my work place. But because the store needed to recruit new people to take over my job, I continued to work until new employees joined. It is my daily life to take an hour's bus every day.

T-Mobile Product Introducer<br><br>
In June 2019,I have never been in contact with the telephone industry, and I entered the T-Mobile branch because of my friend's recommendation. After discussing with my manager, my salary will be set at $15 an hour, and there will be a 5% commission on what I sell. I didn't know what to do on my first day, but my manager taught me patiently. But I didn't sell the product because I didn't know the product. On the third day of my work, I successfully recommended a mobile phone case to the guest, and the price was 30.99 USD each. So I got it 1.55 USD for commissionã€‚I'm happy, but it's not enough. In the following three months, I sold more and more goods. But I didn't like this job, so I quit.
